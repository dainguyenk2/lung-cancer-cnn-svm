# Lung Cancer Detection using CNN and SVM

## 🚀 Overview
This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for lung cancer detection using medical imaging data. The model is trained to classify images into cancerous or non-cancerous categories.

---



## ✨ Features
- Efficient lung cancer detection using CNN and SVM
- Preprocessed medical images for better accuracy
- Visual representation of predictions
- User-friendly UI built with PyQt

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow 2.12+
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- PyQt5
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
```

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dainguyenk2/lung-cancer-cnn-svm.git
    cd lung-cancer-cnn-svm
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

---

## 🧪 Usage
- Launch the UI using the `cancer.ui` file.
- Upload an image (chest X-ray).
- The model will classify it as either **Cancerous** or **Non-Cancerous**.
